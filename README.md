Extract and find/replace text based on arbitrary correspondences. This library is a fork from the Textract library by Dean Malmgren. https://github.com/deanmalmgren/textract


# Documentation

## Installation
To install, you must have Python 3.4+ and pip installed.
```{r, engine='python', count_lines}
pip install convertextract
```
Some source libraries need to be installed for different operating systems to support various file formats. Visit <http://textract.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html> for documentation.

=========

## Basic CLI Use

Some basic Textract functions are preserved. Please visit <http://textract.readthedocs.org> for documentation.

#### Converting a file based on pre-existing Mappings in the G2P library

Under the hood, convertextract uses the [g2p](https://github.com/roedoejet/g2p) library to do conversions. There are many mappings available through that library. For a list of all possible mappings, please visit <https://g2pstudio-herokuapp.com/api/v1/langs>.

For this type of call, convertextract requires three arguments:

1. A file containing text to convert (as of Version 1.0.4, this includes **.pptx**, **.docx**, **.xlsx**, and **.txt**)
2. A code corresponding to the input language of the text.
3. A code corresponding to the desired output language of the text.

Running the command:
```{r, engine='python', count_lines}
convertextract path/to/foo.docx -il eng-ipa -ol eng-arpabet
```

Will produce a new file `path/to/foo_converted.docx` which will contain the same content as `path/to/foo.docx` but with find/replace performed for all correspondences listed in the mapping between English IPA (eng-ipa) and English Arpabet (eng-arpabet). 

#### Converting a file based on custom mapping
If the mapping you want is not supported by g2p, you should make a pull request there to have it included! Otherwise, you can use a custom file.

Running the command:
```{r, engine='python', count_lines}
convertextract path/to/foo.docx -m path/to/rules.csv
```

Will produce a new file `path/to/foo_converted.docx` which will contain the same content as `path/to/foo.docx` but with find/replace performed for all correspondences listed in the mapping at `path/to/rules.csv`. 

#### Creating an .xlsx/.csv/.psv/.tsv correspondence sheet
Your correspondence sheet must be set up as follows:

|    in   |  out           |
|:-:|:-:|
| aa| å| 
| oe| ø|
| ae| æ|

Here, this correspondence sheet (do not include headers like "replace with" or "find") would replace all instances of aa, oe, or ae in a given file with å, ø, or æ respectively.

#### Supported conversions

As of Version 3.0, any mappings that are valid in the g2p library are supported. Here are a few:

* Heiltsuk Doulos Font -> Unicode
```{r, engine='python', count_lines}
convertextract path/to/foo.docx -il hei -ol hei-doulos
```

* Heiltsuk Times Font -> Unicode
```{r, engine='python', count_lines}
convertextract path/to/foo.docx -il hei -ol hei-times
```

* Tsilhqot'in Doulos Font -> Unicode
```{r, engine='python', count_lines}
convertextract path/to/foo.docx -il clc -ol clc-doulos
```

* Navajo Times Font -> Unicode
```{r, engine='python', count_lines}
convertextract path/to/foo.docx -il nav -ol nav-times
```

#### Using Regular Expressions

As of Version 1.5, there is support for Regular Expressions. If you do not need to use context-sensitive conversions, you do not need to include them. However, if you do, you should set up your correspondence sheet as follows:

|    in   |  out  |  context_before | context_after |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| aa| å|[k,d]|$| 
| aa| æ|t|$|
| aa| a:|||

For more information on how the g2p is acutally processed, please visit <https://github.com/roedoejet/g2p>.

#### Use as Python package
You can use the package in a Python script, which returns converted text, but without formatting. Running the script will still create a `foo_converted.docx` file.
```python
import convertextract
text = convertextract.process('foo.docx', mapping='bar.xlsx')
```

You can also use convertextract to just convert text in Python using `process_text`.

```python
import convertextract
text = convertextract.process_text('test', mapping=[{'in': 't', 'out': 'p', 'context_before': '^', 'context_after': 'e'}])
```

## Use with GUI (Graphical User Interface)

Convertextract can also run in a GUI (for Mac 10.14.6 or higher **only**)

### Installing the GUI
To download the app, go to [https://github.com/roedoejet/convertextract/releases](https://github.com/roedoejet/convertextract/releases) and select the most recent version.

![download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roedoejet/convertextract/master/docs/assets/download.png)

Click to unzip the file, and then *right-click* and select `open`. You must *right-click* or the Mac permissions will not allow you to open the app.

![open](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roedoejet/convertextract/master/docs/assets/open.png)

### Using the GUI
The Convertextract app has four arguments:

1.  A file containing text to convert (As of version 3.2.2 **.csv**,
 **.psv**, **.tsv**, **.doc**, **.docx**, **.txt**, **.eaf**, **.json**, **.pptx**, **.html**, **.xls**, **.xlsx** are supported).

2.  A code that specifies the desired encoding, for example `UTF-8`.

3. A code corresponding to the input language of the text.
    
4.  A code corresponding to the desired output language of the text.

There is also the option for custom g2p lookup tables if your mapping is not already in the [g2p](https://github.com/roedoejet/g2p) library.

![gui](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roedoejet/convertextract/master/docs/assets/gui.png)

The GUI will produce a new file `path/to/foo_converted.docx` which will contain the same content as `path/to/foo.docx` but with find/replace performed for all correspondences listed in the mapping. The file format will remain the same as the input file.
